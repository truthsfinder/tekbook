# tekbook

TekBook is an Android application that is mainly for posting of books online either an old one or a new one. 

This will save your space at home or in the best case, can get you a profit out of your sold out books. The seller can be contacted via phone or via their registered emails.

# RUNNING THE APP
This project is created using a pure or native Android way of coding and the database that is connected is under my free registered webhost. 
But you can still upload to your own database.

* Download or clone this repository in your local machine.
* Open your Android Studio and open the downloaded repository
* Run the application by clicking the RUN button or getting its APK to make it run for your Android device.

# Note: 
* If you want to use the current database that is currently registered, just disregard uploading it to your own hosting.
* Make sure to have an internet connection.
* You must have an Android Studio application for you to get the output of the app.
